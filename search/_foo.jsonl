This is my code: decimal trans = trackBar1.Value / 5000; this.Opacity = trans; When I build the application, it gives the following error: Cannot implicitly convert type 'decimal' to 'double'. I tried using trans and double but then the control doesn't work. This code worked fine in a past VB.NET project. "}
